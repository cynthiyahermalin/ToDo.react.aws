###Frontend (React)
```/src
  ├── components
  │   ├── TaskForm.js         # Form for adding tasks
  │   ├── TaskList.js         # Displays the list of tasks
  ├── utils
  │   ├── apiConfig.js        # Contains API URL configuration
  ├── App.js                  # Main application logic and API connections
  ├── App.css                 # Styles for the application
  ├── index.js                # Entry point for React app

##Configuration
1. Set up your API URL in the *src/utils/apiConfig.js* file.
2. Ensure AWS services (Lambda, DynamoDB, IAM roles, and API Gateway) are properly configured.
---
##Backend Architecture
-**AWS Lambda**: Handles backend logic, such as CRUD operations for tasks.
-**DynamoDB**: NoSQL database to store task data.
-**IAM Roles**: Used to manage permissions and secure access.
-**API Gateway**: Connects the React frontend to the backend Lambda functions.
---
##API Integration
###Connecting API with Frontend:
-==App.js== includes Axios calls with ==async== and ==await== to interact with the API.
-API URL is configured in the *src/utils/apiConfig.js* file.

###TaskForm Component:

-Handles task creation via user input.
-Submits data to the backend using an API call.

###TaskList Component:

-Displays all tasks retrieved from the backend.
-Allows updates and deletions via corresponding API calls.
