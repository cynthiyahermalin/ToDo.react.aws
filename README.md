Backend Architecture
AWS Lambda: Handles backend logic, such as CRUD operations for tasks.
DynamoDB: NoSQL database to store task data.
IAM Roles: Used to manage permissions and secure access.
API Gateway: Connects the React frontend to the backend Lambda functions.
API Integration

App.js includes Axios calls with async and await to interact with the API.
API URL is configured in the src/utils/apiConfig.js file.
TaskForm Component:

Handles task creation via user input.
Submits data to the backend using an API call.
TaskList Component:

Displays all tasks retrieved from the backend.
Allows updates and deletions via corresponding API calls.
